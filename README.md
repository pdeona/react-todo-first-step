This repository corresponds to this Medium article: [Building a Modern React.js App with Flow](https://medium.com/@pedro_19839/building-a-modern-react-js-app-with-flow-876ff829a5cd)
This is part one in a three part series on building modern React apps using
Flow, Webpack, Redux and Firebase

In part one, we built a simple (vanilla - no redux) React app with Babel for
supporting modern JS syntax, Flow for static type checking and Webpack for an
optimal Development experience (hot reloading, file loaders)
